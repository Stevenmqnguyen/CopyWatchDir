 * Description
 * 	Daemon process that will watch a folder and respond to specific file operations that occur in that folder.
 *	The daemon will read its configuration parameters from a CONFIG file and then operate according to that configuration.
 *  When it detects a write, the daemon will immediately create a copy of the just written file and store that copy in a
 *  .versions subfolder. Each copy stored in the .versions subfolder will have a date stamp appended to the filename.
